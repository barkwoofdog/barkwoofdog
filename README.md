hello i'm dog.  
I'm a huge fan of networking, linux, and homeserver. Currently I host all my services on a PC I built from old parts that runs Ubuntu, and most services ran in Docker containers.
This is just gonna be little stuff and walkthroughs for stuff i think is cool or might be helpful.
My goal is to be a Linux System Engineer. Currently I work in Cyber Security, but still maintain some Linux systems.


my hobbies include weightlifting, gaming, history (both world and computing/the internet), and reading. 
thanks for checking out my profile! I hope you find something that is useful, or that gives you an idea.
