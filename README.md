hello i'm dog. i work at a cool company where i get to do cool work.
my main experience is in BASH and PowerShell scripting, as I do a lot of that at my job. i'm a big fan of linux as well (i use mint on my laptop, a dell xps15)
i graduated college in winter 2020 and got a great job about 6 months after, so i am still getting my sealegs in the workforce.
the focus of this github will be guides on selfhosting. now that i don't make minimum wage i am able to set up my own hardware instead of someone else's
