hello i'm dog.  
I'm a huge fan of networking, linux, and homeserver. Currently I host all my services on a PC I built from old parts that runs Ubuntu, and most services ran in Docker containers.
This is just gonna be little stuff and walkthroughs for stuff i think is cool or might be helpful.
My goal is to be a DevOps Engineer so I am working towards certs and projects that will help me accomplish that goal.
